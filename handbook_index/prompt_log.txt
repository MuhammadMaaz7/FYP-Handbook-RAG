Question: What headings, fonts, and sizes are required in the FYP report?

Context:
(p. 40) BS Final Year Project Handbook 2023 Body Chapters Conclusions and/ or Recommendations Present a summary of what you found in the results section. Here you should describe the techniques that you used for each analysis and the results of each analysis. Conclusions are broad generalizations that focus on addressing the questions to answer which the project was undertaken. Recommendations are your choices for strategies or tactics based on your conclusions. Quite often authors are tempted to speculate on outcomes that cannot be supported by the findings. Do not draw any conclusions or make any recommendations that your work cannot clearly support. References This section should list all existing information sources used in the FYP. It is important to allow the reader to see all of the sources used and enable the reader to further explore these sources to verify the information presented. Appendix/ces This section should include all supporting information from the project that was not included in the body of the report. You should include surveys, complex statistical calculations, certain detailed tables, and other such information in an appendix. The information presented in this section is important to support the work presented in the body of the report but would make it more difficult to read and understand the work if presented within the body of the report. Appendixes may include maps, graphs, charts, or other helpful material. Cite the appendix items in the report narrative (write "see Appendix A") and organize appendices (e.g., Appendix A, Appendix B, etc.) FAST-NUCES 37

(p. 39) BS Final Year Project Handbook 2023 Authors' Declaration This states Authors' declaration that the work presented in the report is their own, and has not been submitted/presented previously to any other institution or organization. Abstract (optional) (50 to 125 words) Three to five sentences describing the essence of the work. An abstract is a short, 50-125 words summary of a work. An Abstract should state the purpose, findings, and conclusions of your work without commenting on or evaluating the work itself. Put the abstract on a separate page that follows the title page. Acknowledgments (if any) Executive Summary: The executive summary should be one to two pages' overview of the information contained in the FYP report. It should give the reader an easy reference, in a very brief form, to the important information contained in the report and explained in more detail in the body of the report. People reading the report will use this section as a reference during presentations. Table of Contents The table of contents lists the information contained in the report in the order in which it will be found. All major topics of interest should be listed. Introduction The introduction should contain a brief overview of the problem being addressed and the background information needed for the reader to understand the work being done and the reasoning behind it. After reading the introduction, the reader should know exactly what the report is about, why the work was done, and how this work adds to the knowledge that the reader may have about the topic. 36 FAST-NUCES

Question: What goes into the Executive Summary and Abstract?

Context:
(p. 39) BS Final Year Project Handbook 2023 Authors' Declaration This states Authors' declaration that the work presented in the report is their own, and has not been submitted/presented previously to any other institution or organization. Abstract (optional) (50 to 125 words) Three to five sentences describing the essence of the work. An abstract is a short, 50-125 words summary of a work. An Abstract should state the purpose, findings, and conclusions of your work without commenting on or evaluating the work itself. Put the abstract on a separate page that follows the title page. Acknowledgments (if any) Executive Summary: The executive summary should be one to two pages' overview of the information contained in the FYP report. It should give the reader an easy reference, in a very brief form, to the important information contained in the report and explained in more detail in the body of the report. People reading the report will use this section as a reference during presentations. Table of Contents The table of contents lists the information contained in the report in the order in which it will be found. All major topics of interest should be listed. Introduction The introduction should contain a brief overview of the problem being addressed and the background information needed for the reader to understand the work being done and the reasoning behind it. After reading the introduction, the reader should know exactly what the report is about, why the work was done, and how this work adds to the knowledge that the reader may have about the topic. 36 FAST-NUCES

(p. 40) BS Final Year Project Handbook 2023 Body Chapters Conclusions and/ or Recommendations Present a summary of what you found in the results section. Here you should describe the techniques that you used for each analysis and the results of each analysis. Conclusions are broad generalizations that focus on addressing the questions to answer which the project was undertaken. Recommendations are your choices for strategies or tactics based on your conclusions. Quite often authors are tempted to speculate on outcomes that cannot be supported by the findings. Do not draw any conclusions or make any recommendations that your work cannot clearly support. References This section should list all existing information sources used in the FYP. It is important to allow the reader to see all of the sources used and enable the reader to further explore these sources to verify the information presented. Appendix/ces This section should include all supporting information from the project that was not included in the body of the report. You should include surveys, complex statistical calculations, certain detailed tables, and other such information in an appendix. The information presented in this section is important to support the work presented in the body of the report but would make it more difficult to read and understand the work if presented within the body of the report. Appendixes may include maps, graphs, charts, or other helpful material. Cite the appendix items in the report narrative (write "see Appendix A") and organize appendices (e.g., Appendix A, Appendix B, etc.) FAST-NUCES 37

(p. 43) BS Final Year Project Handbook 2023 Indentation Indent all quotations comprising 4 or more lines by 5 spaces from left. Page Numbers Except for the title page, number all pages which come before the first page of the body chapters consecutively with lower case roman numerals (i, ii, iii, iv,…). The first page with Arabic numeral (1, 2, 3, and so on) starts from the page of the introduction but it is mentioned from page 2 onwards. Mention page numbers on the top right of the page. The first page of each section or chapter will not carry the page number; however, the page number will be counted for the proceeding page. Headers The header will comprise the title of the Project report. On every odd page will appear the title of the report while on the even pages the title of the chapter or section will be mentioned. The first page of every section or chapter shall not carry the header. 40 FAST-NUCES

(p. 41) BS Final Year Project Handbook 2023 Any tables, figures, form, or other materials that are not totally central to the analysis but that need to be shown are placed in the Appendix. Footnotes/ End Notes Footnotes are located at the bottom of a page. End notes are like footnotes but are located at the back rather than the bottom of each page. These would include all of the references for all works cited in the review of related literature or any other sections of the report as well as the references for quotations, either direct or indirect, taken from other sources, or any footnote comments that might have been included. These are listed in numeric order as presented in the text. 1. Lani Arredondo (1999) Business Presentations, McGraw-Hill, pp. 23-34. 2. Jann Schill (1996) On Purpose, Heinemann, Australia, p. 23. 3. Paul Tench (1981) Pronunciation Skills, Macmillan, p. 23. In case an endnote is followed by another citing the same source, only the word: “Ibid” (as above) shall substitute for the entire text. If the page no. is different, then the page number shall appear after the word: “Ibid”. For example: 1. Jann Schill (1996) On Purpose, Heinemann, Australia, p. 23. Ibid., p. 54. In case the same source comes to be mentioned after a few interrupting sources, then the word “op cit” would suffice (mentioned earlier is written), followed by the page number. Bibliography or Literature Cited Bibliography will appear in alphabetic order of the authors' surnames. Author's surname shall come first as is the case in the catalogues of libraries. 38 FAST-NUCES
